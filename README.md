1.I developed an AI assistant using Python that leverages natural language processing to understand and respond to user queries. This project showcases my skills in machine learning and programming, enabling users to interact with the assistant for various tasks, such as answering questions, providing recommendations, and automating simple processes.

2.I created a BMI calculator using Python that allows users to easily calculate their Body Mass Index based on height and weight inputs. This project demonstrates my ability to develop user-friendly applications and implement basic health-related algorithms, providing instant feedback and promoting awareness of healthy weight management.

3.I developed a random password generator using Python that creates secure passwords of 8 characters in length. This tool ensures that each password contains a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters, enhancing security for users. The project demonstrates my ability to implement randomization and string manipulation techniques effectively.

4.A weather prediction project using API requests in Python involves fetching real-time weather data from a service like OpenWeatherMap. This project can include features such as displaying current weather conditions, forecasts, and visualizing data trends, enhancing user experience and understanding of meteorological patterns.
